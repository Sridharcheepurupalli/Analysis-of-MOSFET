# Analysis-of-MOSFET
This repository contains extensive simulations and analyses of MOSFETs using circuit simulation tools. Explore various types of analyses including DC, AC, transient, noise and parametric sweep analyses to characterize MOSFET behavior under different conditions. 

### Analysis of MOSFET models
The components used are:\
`nmos 1v` - from analoglib\
`vdc`- from analgolib<br/>

**Output Characteristics Analysis (Id vs Vds)**

When sweeping the drain-source voltage  Vds for various gate-source voltages Vgs, the plot below shows what we observed in our analysis.

**Transfer Characteristics Analysis(Id vs Vgs)**

Performing a DC sweep on the gate-source voltage Vgs across various values of drain-source voltage Vds the plot below shows what we observed in our analysis.
