# Analysis-of-MOSFET
This repository contains extensive simulations and analyses of MOSFETs using circuit simulation tools. Explore various types of analyses including DC, AC, transient, noise and parametric sweep analyses to characterize MOSFET behavior under different conditions. 

### Analysis of MOSFET models
The components used are:\
`nmos 1v` - from analoglib\
`vdc`- from analgolib<br/>
